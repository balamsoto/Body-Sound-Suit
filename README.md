Body-Sound-Suit
===============

The Body Sound Suit is a bio-gesture capture and trigger system; it is inspired by the arduino drum project.     The suit captures human gestures/body movements and translates it into data; this captured data then triggers sound and graphics.  The body of the dancer becomes a generator of sound and visual data; the dancer creates his/her own audio and visual environment simply by moving the body â€“ by dancing.
